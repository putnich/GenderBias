# Gender Bias

The research on bias in language models has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. The gender bias, or sexism, is defined as the discrimination to a certain gender, principally women. Beside spoken language, gender bias is also expressed in many forms of written language, such as news articles. This allows it to be reflected in language models as well, influencing metrics and pulling specific words towards one gender. In the case of workspace, those words can be related to jobs, occupations and roles. 

In English, jobs such as businessman, surgeon, and lieutenant are considered to be more male, while housewives and nurses are more associated with women. So, some job titles exhibit the stereotype towards male and some towards female cases. With the emergence of the job interviews based on AI and Natural language processing (NLP) technology, a strong stereotype, i.e. bias in language models can affect people's careers and lives. 

This notebook presents an investigation of gender bias in word embedding models for the Serbian language. Specifically, we focus on job titles and gender determining words, i.e. we test whether some job titles are more associated with one gender than the other.
